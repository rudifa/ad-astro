mac tool to check for valid json

## AI answer
Based on the search results, there are several tools available for macOS to check and validate JSON:

1.  Dadroit JSON Viewer:  
    This is a powerful tool for handling large JSON files on macOS. It offers features like advanced search capabilities and conversion options [1](https://dadroit.com/blog/json-viewer-mac/).
2.  OK JSON - Viewer & Formatter:  
    This is a native macOS app specifically designed for JSON formatting and viewing. It offers features like:

*   JSON structure in both tree view and text editor
*   Support for drag-and-drop, Dark Mode, and URL Schemes
*   Built-in support for jq and JSONPath
*   Ability to process JSON with custom scripts [2](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ok-json-viewer-formatter/id1576121509?mt=12)

3.  JSON Viewer:  
    This is a free, lightweight native Mac app for visualizing, validating, and formatting JSON datasets. Key features include:

*   Syntax highlighting
*   Interactive navigation through large datasets
*   Ability to prettify or minify JSON
*   Automatic error highlighting for invalid syntax [4](https://jsonviewer.app)

4.  jsonlint:  
    This is a command-line tool available through Homebrew. It's a JSON parser and validator that can be used in the terminal [5](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jsonlint).
5.  JSON Validation:  
    This is a Mac App Store application that can validate JSON and convert it to classes in various programming languages [6](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/json-validation/id1086706933?mt=12).

For a simple command-line approach, you can use the `jq` tool, which is often already installed on macOS. To check if a string is valid JSON, you can use this command:

```bash
echo '{"key": "value"}' | jq . >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "Valid JSON" || echo "Invalid JSON"
```

This command will output "Valid JSON" if the input is valid JSON, and "Invalid JSON" if it's not [3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46954692/check-if-string-is-a-valid-json-with-jq). Each of these tools offers different features and interfaces, so you can choose the one that best fits your specific needs and preferences for working with JSON on macOS.
