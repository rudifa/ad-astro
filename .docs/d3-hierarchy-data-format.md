d3.hierarchy(data): what are the rules that the data (format, structure) must obey to be acceptable?

## AI answer

To use d3.hierarchy(data) effectively, the input data must adhere to the following rules and structure:

1.  The data must be a hierarchical object or nested JSON structure [2](https://d3js.org/d3-hierarchy/hierarchy).
2.  The root node should be an object representing the top-level of the hierarchy [2](https://d3js.org/d3-hierarchy/hierarchy).
3.  Each node in the hierarchy should have a "children" property (by default) that contains an array of its child nodes [2](https://d3js.org/d3-hierarchy/hierarchy). For example:

```javascript
const data = {
  name: "Root",
  children: [
    {
      name: "Child 1",
      children: [
        { name: "Grandchild 1" },
        { name: "Grandchild 2" }
      ]
    },
    { name: "Child 2" }
  ]
}
```

4.  If your data uses a different property name for child nodes, you can specify a custom children accessor function as the second argument to d3.hierarchy() [2](https://d3js.org/d3-hierarchy/hierarchy).
5.  Leaf nodes (nodes with no children) should not have a "children" property or should have an empty array for the "children" property [2](https://d3js.org/d3-hierarchy/hierarchy).
6.  The data can include additional properties for each node beyond just "name" and "children". These will be accessible in the resulting hierarchy [2](https://d3js.org/d3-hierarchy/hierarchy).
7.  If your data is not already in a hierarchical format, you may need to use d3.stratify() to convert flat data into a hierarchical structure before using d3.hierarchy() [2](https://d3js.org/d3-hierarchy/hierarchy) [3](https://d3js.org/d3-hierarchy).
8.  The input data should not contain circular references, as d3.hierarchy() expects a tree-like structure [2](https://d3js.org/d3-hierarchy/hierarchy).
9.  While not strictly required, it's often useful to include a unique identifier for each node to facilitate data binding and updates [4](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69227080/transform-flat-json-object-to-hierarchical-d3-object-structure).

By following these rules, you ensure that your data is properly structured for d3.hierarchy() to create a hierarchical layout that can be used with various D3 tree visualization methods like d3.tree(), d3.cluster(), or d3.pack() [2](https://d3js.org/d3-hierarchy/hierarchy) [3](https://d3js.org/d3-hierarchy).

## User
so, "name" and "children" are reserved field names?

## AI answer
You're partially correct, but let me clarify:

1.  "children" is indeed a reserved field name by default in d3.hierarchy(). It's the property that d3.hierarchy() looks for to identify child nodes.
2.  "name" is not actually a reserved field name. It's commonly used in examples, but d3.hierarchy() doesn't treat it specially. You can use any property name for the node's label or identifier.

To be more precise:

Reserved field name:


*   "children": This is the default property name for child nodes.

Not reserved, but commonly used:


*   "name": Often used for node labels, but not required or special to d3.hierarchy().

It's important to note:

1.  You can override the "children" accessor if your data uses a different property name for child nodes. For example:

```javascript
d3.hierarchy(data, d => d.descendants)
```

This would use "descendants" instead of "children" to identify child nodes.

2.  You can add any other properties to your data nodes, and they will be accessible in the resulting hierarchy. For example:

```javascript
const data = {
  id: "root",
  label: "Root Node",
  value: 100,
  children: [
    { id: "child1", label: "Child 1", value: 50 },
    { id: "child2", label: "Child 2", value: 50 }
  ]
}
```

In this case, "id", "label", and "value" are all custom properties that will be available in the hierarchy. So, while "children" is indeed a special property name (unless overridden), you have a lot of flexibility with other property names in your data structure.

## User
in the example 2., ""id", "label", and "value" are all custom properties that will be available in the hierarchy", but which will be chosen by hierarchy()?

## AI answer
You're right to ask for clarification on this point. Let me explain how d3.hierarchy() handles custom properties:

1.  d3.hierarchy() primarily focuses on creating the hierarchical structure based on the "children" property (or a custom children accessor if provided).
2.  All other properties in your data objects are preserved and accessible through the `data` property of each node in the resulting hierarchy. However, they are not directly added as properties of the hierarchy nodes themselves.

To be more precise:

> Properties directly added by d3.hierarchy():


*   children
*   depth
*   height
*   parent

> Custom properties:


Custom properties like "id", "label", and "value" are not directly added to the hierarchy node. Instead, they are accessible through the `data` property of each node. For example, if you have a data structure like this:

```javascript
const data = {
  id: "root",
  label: "Root Node",
  value: 100,
  children: [
    { id: "child1", label: "Child 1", value: 50 },
    { id: "child2", label: "Child 2", value: 50 }
  ]
}

const root = d3.hierarchy(data);
```

You would access the custom properties like this:

```javascript
console.log(root.data.id);    // "root"
console.log(root.data.label); // "Root Node"
console.log(root.data.value); // 100

console.log(root.children[0].data.id);    // "child1"
console.log(root.children[0].data.label); // "Child 1"
console.log(root.children[0].data.value); // 50
```

It's important to note that while these custom properties are preserved in the `data` object, they are not used directly by d3.hierarchy() for structuring the hierarchy. The hierarchy structure is based solely on the "children" property (or custom children accessor). If you need to use these custom properties for calculations or visualizations, you often need to access them through the `data` property or use methods like `node.sum()` to compute values based on these properties.

## User
so, would this work : const data = {  
  children: \[  
    { },  
    { }  
  \]  
}

## AI answer
Yes, that data structure would work with d3.hierarchy(). Let's break it down:

```javascript
const data = {
  children: [
    {  },
    {  }
  ]
}
```

This is a valid input for d3.hierarchy() because:

1.  It has a root object.
2.  The root object has a "children" property.
3.  The "children" property is an array containing child objects.

Here's what d3.hierarchy() would do with this data:

1.  It would create a root node corresponding to the outermost object.
2.  It would create two child nodes, one for each empty object in the "children" array.

However, there are a few things to note:

1.  This is a minimal structure. While it works, it doesn't include any data properties that you might typically want for visualization or analysis.
2.  The root node and child nodes don't have any properties other than "children". This means that when you access `node.data` on any of these nodes, you'll get an empty object for the children and an object with only the "children" property for the root.
3.  This structure doesn't have any leaf nodes (nodes without children). Both child nodes are empty objects, which d3.hierarchy() will treat as potential parent nodes with no children.

Here's how you might use and inspect this structure:

```javascript
const root = d3.hierarchy(data);

console.log(root.children.length);  // 2
console.log(root.children[0].data); // {}
console.log(root.children[1].data); // {}
```

While this minimal structure works, in practice, you'd typically want to include more data in your nodes for meaningful visualizations or analyses. For example:

```javascript
const data = {
  name: "Root",
  children: [
    { name: "Child 1" },
    { name: "Child 2" }
  ]
}
```

This would give you something to display or work with for each node in your hierarchy.

## User
Sure, my example is not practical (for the lack of additional properties), but you did confirm my understanding so far; it appears that a minimal nodes structures would be : NODE: {} OR { children: \[\]} OR { children: \[NODE, ...\]}

## AI answer
You're absolutely correct! Your understanding is spot-on. Let's formalize this minimal structure you've described:

Minimal Node Structures


1.  Empty Node: `{}`
    
    *   This is a leaf node with no children and no additional properties.
    
2.  Childless Node: `{ children: [] }`
    
    *   This explicitly states that the node has no children.
    *   Functionally equivalent to an empty node `{}` in d3.hierarchy().
    
3.  Parent Node: `{ children: [NODE, ...] }`
    
    *   This is a node with one or more children.
    *   Each child (NODE) can be any of these three types recursively.
    

You've captured the essence of the minimal structure required for d3.hierarchy(). This understanding is crucial because it shows that:

1.  The only truly required property for d3.hierarchy() to function is "children" (when present).
2.  A node without a "children" property is treated as a leaf node.
3.  The hierarchy can be arbitrarily deep, as each child can itself be a parent node.

To illustrate this, here's a valid, albeit minimal, complex structure:

```javascript
const data = {
  children: [
    {},
    { children: [] },
    { children: [
        { children: [{}] },
        {}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This structure, while not practical for visualization purposes, is entirely valid for d3.hierarchy() and demonstrates all three types of minimal nodes you've identified. Your understanding provides a solid foundation for working with d3.hierarchy(). In practice, you'll usually want to add more properties to your nodes for data visualization purposes, but knowing the minimal required structure is valuable for understanding how d3.hierarchy() operates at its core.
